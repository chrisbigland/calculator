## Description

The project consists of 3 main aims:

1. To build a working calculator. 
2. To practice using Git and GitHub flow. 
3. To apply what I've been learning in the course so far. An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.


The calculator I have created accepts multiple inputs (including numbers with decimal places), can perform an addition, subtraction, multiplication or division operation and returns the output accurately. It also has a button to clear the number on the screen. 

I applied my knowledge of HTML to create the markup for my page, adding ids/classes and tags as appropriate. I used CSS to create a more attractive design whilst ensuring that it would be responsive to different screen sizes by testing my knowledge of media queries. I also implemented flex-boxes and grid layouts to ensure the positioning on the page was as I wanted it.

I implemented my recently acquired knowledge of JavaScript, utilising variables, functions, arrays and array iterators, fixing bugs using the console and manipulating the DOM in order to create a simple functioning calculator. 

On top of this I conducted my own independent research into certain methods new to me that I wished to use.
